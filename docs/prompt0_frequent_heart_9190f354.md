implement a basic CLI tool, that can be easily extended with multiple sub commands. 

also, make sure that we can install this project and run the cli. 

also, rename this project so that running `pip install -e .`. gives you `zero-ai-dev-framework --help`

also have `zero-ai-dev-framework dev `, which includes `zero-ai-dev-framework dev --update-toc` which creates a file `docs/CONTENTS.md`, which uses funcs `docs_tools` which will generate the toc in "docs/CONTENTS.md"
